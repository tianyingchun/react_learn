### We will use use React and Reflux as Node modules and use Browserify to make them available on the client side as well. So, here is how we set up the environment:

1. We will use Browserify to bundle up our React components, Actions and Stores into a client side .js package.

2. We will use `grunt watch` to detect changes in the above components and re-run Browserify every time a change occurs.

3. `grunt nodemon` is used to restart the server whenever any .jsx or .js file is changed so that you donâ€™t have to do it manually.


You can download the code from [GitHub] and open up Gruntfile.js to read about the tasks. Once you have the repo on your machine you can just run npm install to install the required node modules. Run the following commands and start development:
